This project is to develop an automated fabric quality inspection machine using computer vision and machine learning. A prototype is being implemented using an array of industrial inspection cameras that are interfaced for parallel acquisition of images, image processing software on parallel processors, image classification using a state-of-the-art classifier, and web-based control, monitoring, and reporting.
