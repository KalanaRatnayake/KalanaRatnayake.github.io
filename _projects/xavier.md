<b>Tech Stack:</b> [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/), [Octomap Library](https://octomap.github.io/), [Turtlebot system](https://www.turtlebot.com/)

This project is to develop a multi-robot system that collaboratively maps an arena in 3D. The individual robots autonomously navigate through the map to an optimal frontier for efficient area exploration. The system is designed to work without an initial map to suit application scenarios such as disaster rescue. [More details](https://uom.lk/cse/labs/IntelliSense/projects)
