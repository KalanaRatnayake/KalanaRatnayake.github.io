I am a Research Engineer at [Intellisense Lab](https://uom.lk/cse/labs/IntelliSense) of the University of Moratuwa working on developing an Unmanned Ground Vehicle suitable for spaces such as construction sites, storage yards, production floor warehouses, post-disaster environments. I work as a member of the team building the UGV and currently responsible for the firmware of the robot. Previously I contributed to the design and development of the navigation and exploration system of the robot.

I completed my Master's at the University of Moratuwa in 2021. It focused on developing a navigation system that uses volumetric data for multi-robot exploration in an unknown environment and was co-supervised by Dr. Chandana Gamage and Dr. Sulochana Sooriyaarachchi. During this time I also worked as a Research Assistant and as a Visiting Instructor for the CS4352-Robotics and Automation module.

I earned my BSc (Hons) Engineering degree specializing in Computer Science and Engineering in 2020. My research focused on developing a motion planner to explore unknown terrain.
