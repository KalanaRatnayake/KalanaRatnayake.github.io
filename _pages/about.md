I am a Software Engineer at Intellisense Lab of Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka working on developing an automated Fabric Quality Inspection system.

Previously, I was a Masters' student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Moratuwa, Co-supervised by Dr. Chandana Gamage and Dr. Sulochana Sooriyaarachchi. My Master's research focused on developing a navigation system that uses volumetric data for multi robot exploration in an unknown environment. I'm passionate about learning and developing robotics systems and so far my research focused on navigation systems. During this time I worked as a Research Assistant at the in the Fabric Quality Inspection system project and as a Visiting Instructor for Robotics and Automation module at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Moratuwa.

In 2020, I graduated from the Bachelor of Science (Honours) Engineering degree specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a Second Class Upper Division. My Final Year Research Project focused on developing a motion planner for a wheeled robot to explore a unknown terrain.

My research interests include

- Robotics Navigation and Control
- Robotics Exploration
